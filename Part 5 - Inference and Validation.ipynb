    "# Inference and Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have a trained network, you can use it for making predictions. This is typically called **inference**, a term borrowed from statistics. However, neural networks have a tendency to perform *too well* on the training data and aren't able to generalize to data that hasn't been seen before. This is called **overfitting** and it impairs inference performance. To test for overfitting while training, we measure the performance on data not in the training set called the **validation** dataset. We avoid overfitting through regularization such as dropout while monitoring the validation performance during training. In this notebook, I'll show you how to do this in PyTorch. \n",

    "As with MNIST, each image in Fashion-MNIST is 28x28 which is a total of 784 pixels, and there are 10 classes. I used `nn.ModuleList` to allow for an arbitrary number of hidden layers. This model has an argument `hidden_layers` that's a list of the hidden layer sizes (as integers). Using `nn.ModuleList` registers each hidden layer module properly so you can use module methods in the model.\n",

    "I also have the `forward` method returning the log-softmax for the output. Since softmax is a probability distibution over the classes, the log-softmax is a log probability which comes with a [lot of benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_probability). Using the log probability, computations are often faster and more accurate. To get the class probabilities later, I'll need to take the exponential (`torch.exp`) of the output.\n",
